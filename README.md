├── README.md        ← GitHub page text
├── LICENSE          ← (MIT License if you want)
└── output/          ← gets auto-created during use

## 🧠 What is SPG2?

SPG2 is a **realistic, psychology-based password generator** that creates 1K–10K passwords the way real people would.  
No garbage like `riya123` — instead, it creates human-style passwords like:

dibakar_thala_07
paswan_407
king_dibakar_143
dibakar_dhoni_lover_2026

---

## 🔥 Key Features

✅ 100% Human-thinking style  
✅ Partner/crush/idol-based logic  
✅ Cultural, emotional, and name-focused  
✅ Age-logic (if < 20, asks city/country)  
✅ Save wordlist or auto-saves if skipped  
✅ Outputs clean `.txt` for brute-force tools

---

## ⚙️ How to Use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SPG2
cd SPG2
python3 spg2.py

You'll be prompted for:

Victim name / age / DOB

Partner/crush name

Idol/celebrity they follow

Location (if under 20)


Tool then generates 1K–10K passwords like:

aryan_loves_riya_2025
riya_ki_jaan_143
thala_dhoni_407
dibakar_cricket_lover


---

💾 Output

Saved in: output/<victim>_wordlist.txt
Default: ~5,000+ passwords per run.
